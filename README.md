# Hi there, I'm DgenKing 👋

### 🏗️ From Carpentry to AI Architecture
I'm a self-taught **"Vibe Coder"** transitioning from **35 years of carpentry** to software development. I treat code like a craft—structured, durable, and built to last.

### 🧠 The Learning Journey
I'm currently working through **The Odin Project** to master the core principles of programming. While I heavily rely on **Claude Code** and **Gemini** to accelerate my builds, I'm dedicated to understanding the "why" behind every line of code.
- 🛠️ **Building:** Web Apps, PWAs, and anything that solves a real problem.
- 📈 **Experience:** I've built 48+ AI projects over 2.5 years. Some were rough, but each one taught me how to make the next one better.

### 💻 Technical Foundation
- **CCNA Certified** – Networking fundamentals
- **Linux/Ubuntu & Docker** – Infrastructure and containerization
- **AI Automation** – Built production systems with Claude, Gemini, and MCP servers
- **Philosophy:** I value honest assessments over hype. Real wins and real failures.

### 🚀 Current Project: [PeakDiet](https://peak-diet.vercel.app/)
Born from **15 years of bodybuilding experience**, PeakDiet is the "Nutrition Architecture" app I built for myself. 
- It balances macros, adjusts portion sizes automatically, and manages burnout. 
- Built with **React 19, Tailwind 4, Neon DB, and Vercel.**
- **What I learned:** Performance optimization with real-time JSON patching, managing state at scale, and building tools people actually use.
- *If it's useful for me, it's a tool. If it's useful for you, it's a bonus.*
